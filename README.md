Two Eyes that look around based upon the movement of your mouse on the page, with a blue background.

## How To Run
Download all files, put in one folder, run eye-movement.html on a browser, refresh page and move your mouse around to run.
## Future Improvements
I would like to add something that makes the eyes do a roll animation when on a click.
